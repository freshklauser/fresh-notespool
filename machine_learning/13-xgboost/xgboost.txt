code of xgboost for feature extraction:

from xgboost import XGBClassifier, plot_importance
# plot_importance: 根据特征重要性排序画图的函数

model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# 绘图
plot_importance(model)
plt.show()

# extract the feature
xgb_feature_filtered = SelectFromModel(model, prefit=True)
# reduce dimension for train and test dataset
x_train_xgb = xgb_feature_filtered.tranform(x_train_org)
x_test_xgb = xgb_feature_filtered.tranform(x_test_org)

x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_test_xgb, test_size=0.2, random_state=3)

model = ...
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

...
model.predict(x_test_xgb)
